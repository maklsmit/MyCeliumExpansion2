The Mushroom Witch's forest has been invaded by healthy-looking trees! Now she must get to the root of the issue using deadly mushroom mycelium to restore her domain to its former icky glory. Ability upgrades can be unlocked as you make progress. 

Press "e" to root and return to the cauldron to get access to mushrooms with different powers. Watch out for those adorable squirrels who will be working against you... shoo them away using [space]!
